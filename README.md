# Portfolio-Sample-Project
Portfolio Website
This is my personal portfolio website, built as a way to practice and improve my HTML and CSS skills. I created it to showcase my work and experiment with different layouts, styles, and design ideas. It’s a reflection of what I’ve learned so far and will keep evolving as I grow my skills.
